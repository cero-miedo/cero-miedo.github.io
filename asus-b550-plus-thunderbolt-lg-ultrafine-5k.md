# Using a LG Ultrafine 5K Display with a PC

I recently built a PC for playing games. I have a nice monitor I wanted to make use of and don't have enough desk space to warrant a third monitor. After a lot of research, I've managed to get my Thunderbolt 5K display working in Windows 10.

In order to do this, you need a motherboard that supports Thunderbolt 3. My PC is built on an Asus TUF Gaming B550-Plus motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 5800x. 

You will also need to buy the appropriate Thunderbolt PCI-Express card. In my case, this was an Asus ThunderboltEx 3-TR. TR is an abbreviation of `Titan Ridge`, the chipset codename. The card is a half size PCI-e slot that requires a 6-pin power connector from the PSU. The card then connects to a 14-pin header on the motherboard and via another USB motherboard header.
